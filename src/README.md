- One of the most popular types of compressed files is one with the.rar extension. Set a password for compressed files to prevent sharing files with unwanted people and objects. However, there are many security risks with rar files:
- There is no limit to the number of times you enter the password.
- Only 1-layer security, meaning that after entering the password, no further authentication is required.
